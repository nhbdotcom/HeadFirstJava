# Code Magnets

## Description
The "Code Magnets" project presents a fun coding challenge where a working Java program is scrambled into snippets. Your task is to rearrange the code snippets to form a complete and functioning Java program that outputs the specified result.

## Challenge
Rearrange the code snippets below to create a working Java program that produces the following output: 
```% java Shuffle1
    a-b c-d
```


## Code Snippets
Here are the scrambled code snippets you need to work with:

```java
if (x == 1) {
    System.out.print("d");
    x = x - 1;
}

if (x == 2) {
    System.out.print("b c");
}

class Shuffle1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        if (x > 2) {
            System.out.print("a");
        }

        int x = 3;

        x = x - 1;
        System.out.print("-");

        while (x > 0) {
            // Curly braces can be added as needed
        }
    }
}
